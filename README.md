# Loan-Prediction-using-Svm-Naive-bayes-and-Random-Forest

At first the dataset was selected and analyzed and then it was pre-processed using various techniques. Different data sets require different pre-processing techniques. And after proper pre-processing it is trained in model and tested. Which ultimately gives accuracy and visualization. Models used in this project are random forest, SVC and Gaussian Naive Bayes.
